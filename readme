•	Our objective is to select the best 11 players from around the world based on specific
key performance parameters.
•	 To achieve this goal, we will follow a multi-step process. First, we will convert the data
from the 2022 T20 World Cup, which is currently in a JSON file, into a CSV file using Python. Next, we will clean and prepare the data in Excel. Once the data is ready, we will import it into Power BI for in-depth analysis. In Power BI, we will create charts and visualizations to gain valuable insights from the data.
